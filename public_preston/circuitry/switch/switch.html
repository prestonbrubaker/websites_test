      <h1>Objective/Overview</h2>
      <p>
        My Goal in this project is to reliably and efficiently control a switch capable of high currents at a distance, with the ability to rapidly toggle the switch. I plan to do this using a Raspberry Pi 4, which contains a set of general purpose input output (GPIO) pins that will allow me to use Python Programs to send low-current signals to circuitry. There are three components to my approach in creating this switch.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>SSH Tunnel for Remote Access:</strong> 
          I will host an SSH server on the Raspberry Pi to allow for Python programs to be executed remotely, and for relevant files and information to be retrieved. I will also utilize Git to create programs to be downloaded onto the pi with the git clone command executed over the SSH.</li>
        <li><strong>Stepper Motor to Provide Work:</strong> 
          A signal will be provided to a driver that will allow for the application of a significant torque in the stepper motor. This torque will provide the work necessary to connect two surfaces of copper together and allow current to flow.</li>
        <li><strong>An Analog to Digital Converter to Test the Switch:</strong> 
          An analog to digital converter will be placed in series with a resistor in a circuit so that to voltage drop across the resistor can be measured, which in turn will allow for the determination of whether the circuit is open or closed. This can be used to collect data to find the reliability and maximum speed of the switch when it is toggled.</li>
      </ul>

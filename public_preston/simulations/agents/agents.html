      <h1>Explanation of the Competitive Agents Simulation</h2>
      <p>
        Each agent swims through the medium and searches for food. A tile that is closer to purple on the rainbow spectrum has 
        more food, and solid red has no food. An agent eats a fraction of the food on the tile it is on each iteration. If it gets 
        enough food, it reproduces and its child is born with small mutations to each trait. At the end of each iteration, each agent 
        loses some of their internal stores of food at a rate dependant on their speed.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Emergent Optimized Strategies:</strong> 
          Each agent can have multiple children. If a child has a mutated trait that makes it better at competing for the 
          limited food available, it is more likely to have children of its own. Because of this, the agents as a whole find 
          better ways to utilize their environment. After sufficient time, they will find a strategies that are more optimized 
          than a human could reasonably preset using intuition alone.</li>
        <li><strong>Prisoner's Dilemma:</strong> 
          Food is generated at a sufficient rate to sustain a fairly large population. Despite this, agents will often become 
          greedy and eat so much food, that they and their children starve waiting for the food to regenerate. They also become 
          fast despite this using up more metabolism. Both of these could be solved with collusion and patience, but any agent who 
          does not remain competitive will die out, so the population as a whole is destined for a sub-optimal solution to resource 
          allocation.</li>
        <li><strong>Reproduction Ratio:</strong> 
          A trait of each organism is their reproduction ratio, being the amount of food they will pass on to their child. 
          Setting this higher means ensuring a greater chance that their child can itself reproduce, but it lowers the chance of an 
          oranism's own chance to survive and have a greater number of children.</li>
      </ul>

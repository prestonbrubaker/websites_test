      <h1>Understanding the Minima Finder</h2>
      <p>
        To analyze and understand a minima finder algortithm, we must first find a set of functions that are especially suitable 
        for understanding how effective a given approach is. Such a set of functions seeks to have the following qualities:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Easy to generate similar functions randomly:</strong> 
          To make a minima finder that is suitable for a range of functions, we should be able to generate functions with similar qualities 
          that are unlikely to have been previously encountered.</li>
        <li><strong>Have a lot of local minima and one or a few global minima:</strong> 
          A decent minima finder should be able to tend towards a nearby local minima. A great minima finder should even be capable of 
          breaking out of local minima in search for the elusive global minima. To differentiate such minima finding algorithms, we want 
          to have most paths down gradient decent lead to local minima, but to have a global minima of known value.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous and differentiable within reasonable bounds:</strong> 
          Navigating a smooth surface allows for a minima-finding-algorithm to showcase its ability. Rough or undefined space rids the 
          searched parameter space of oppurtunities. Having a completely defined parameter space also allows for easier calculations of 
          how effective a minima-finding-algorithm is in comparison to various methods of random and semi-random searches.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        My favorite function that satisfies these conditions is the integral of the squared difference of two sums of sine functions, 
        where one set of summed sine function is initialized with frequency coefficients, and the other set is of the same length, but 
        allowed to vary. The output of this integral is where I get the loss value, which can be said to represent how well the initialized 
        summed set of sine functions is approximized by the set by the given parameters input. For example, the initialized set could be 
        f(x) = sin(.3x) + sin(.6x) + sin(.9x) and this would mean the other set is g(x) = sin(Ax) + sin(Bx) + sin(Cx). The true funciton 
        analyzed by the minima finder would be the integral of (f(x) - g(x,A,B,C))^2 from an arbitrary value such as x=5 to x=10. This 
        generates 0 if f(x) is equal to g(x) providing a global minima. It is impossible for the output of this function to be negative 
        with real inputs. It is A, B, and C in this example that would be altered in search for the local and global minimas.

    <p>
      This is the setpoint control version. This is how it works:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Control Method:</strong> The heater runs at full power when the contents of the vessel are under the setpoint and turns off completely when the contents reach the setpoint.</li>
      <li><strong>Delayed Feedback:</strong> The heat takes a while to make it through to the tank of water. This makes it insufficient to simply use a single if statement and turn the heater on full blast until the tank reaches the set point</li>
      <li><strong>Complex System:</strong> The most optimal power to feed into the heater becomes more challenging to describe analytically with more elements to consider. Furthermore, the a real setup needs to be able to handle noise and outside sources of heat and heat loss. This escapes analytical methods.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Heat Path: </strong>The heat originates in the electric heater, where it is generated by resistive wire. This flows via conduction to the interface surface between the heater and the heating fluid. The heat then flows into the water stream with a dependence on flow rate and the difference in temperature between the interface and the fluid. The heating fluid is then transported to the heating shell of the reactor vessel, where the heat flows into the shell with a dependence on flow and temperature difference. The heat then flow via conduction to the interface between the contents of the reaction vessel where finally it enters the contents of the vessel with a dependence on temperature difference.

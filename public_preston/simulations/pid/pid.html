      <h1>Explanation of my Simulation</h1>
      <p>
        This is a simulation of a basic feedback control process where the goal is to heat a vessel up to 75° C as quickly 
        as possible with minimal overshoot. Below is a basic description of each method.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Setpoint Control:</strong> 
          The heater is run at full power until the vessel contents reach the setpoint. Above the setpoint, the heater is turned completely off.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Proportional Control:</strong> 
          The heater is run at a fraction of it's maximum power which is proportional to how far under the setpoint the vessel contents are.
        </li>
        <li><strong>PD Control:</strong> 
          The heater's power in proportion to it's maximum also is negatively proportional to the rate of temperature increase of the vessel 
          contents. This mitigates the risk of overshoot.
        </li>
        <li><strong>PID Control:</strong> 
          In addition to the proportional term and the derivitave term, there is an integral term that allows for a memory of state. 
          If the temperature sits below the setpoint as it does with proportional and PD control, the integral term will narrow in on 
          the setpoint.
        </li>
        <li><strong>PFD Explanation:</strong> 
          A heating loop uses 1000 kg of ethylene glycol, pumped by a centrifugal pump, to heat up a vessel containing 300 kg of water. 
          The heater consists of a negligable amount of heating wire and 50 kg of steel to interface with the ethylene glycol pipe. 
          The pipe runs in a loop, and is fed into the vessel where it exchanges heat with an exchanger of mass 50kg made of steel. 
          This exchanger also interfaces with the contents of the vessel.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Assumptions:</strong> 
          The heater, ethylene glycol, vessel heat exchanger, and water are each considered to be uniform in temperature. 
          For the ethylene glycol, this assumption is made relying on the flow rate provided by the centrifugal pump allowing the fluid 
          to both mix well, and travel around the piping loop quickly. The heater and the vessel heat exchanger are made of steel of 
          small enough mass and high enough internal conductivity that uniform temperature that they are negligable contributors of the 
          overall heat resistance. The vessel can be imagined to contain a mixer, though it may be well mixed due to inner convection of 
          the water regardless. The rate of flow of the ethylene glycol is considered constant, and this leads to the simplification of the 
          heat transfer at the surfaces to being of linear dependance on temperature difference across the respective surfaces.
        </li>
      </ul>

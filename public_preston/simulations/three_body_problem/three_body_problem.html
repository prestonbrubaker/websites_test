      <p>These three bodies are each gravitationally attracted to each other. If two bodies are brought twice as close, the magnitude of the forces increases four fold. Between the two runs, the red planet being allowed to vary in placement by only 0.000000000001%. If the width of the screen was the distance between the Sun and the Earth, this would mean the variance in placement for the red planet is within only 1.5 milimeters (0.06 inches)!!! With two-bodies, this would mean that two seperate runs would look identical forever assuming no extremely-near collision. With three bodies, however this is enough for any two runs to vary so greatly, that they eventually have no resembelence. I have made the bottom 100 pixels of the canvas allow planets to leave a trail.</p>

            <p>Outside of design, I try to stay pretty involved in the community. Below are some of the ways I have done so in recent times.</p>

                <h1>PSH ASCE Steel Bridge Team Member and PSH ASCE Club Secretary</h1>
                <li>As a member of the Penn State Harrisburg Steel Bridge Team, I spent Tuesday and Thursdays working in the metal shop
                    preparing our 4' sections of our 24' steel bridge for competition. If I wasn't in the shop, you could find me attending 
                    board meetings and helping plan activities.
                </li>

                <h1>Member of Programming and Activities Club (PAC)</h1>
                <li>As a member of one of Penn State Harrisburg's most influential clubs, I helped plan the logistics of campus events, and
                    and helped run Thursday night Bingo. Being a member of this club taught me a lot about budgeting and fund alocation on a 
                    reputable scale (our club had an annual budget of $110,000). More than that even, I learned a lot about networking within 
                    the community and amongst the Penn State Staff as I helped to organize event vendors. If there is an instance of public
                    involvement outsid of working that taught me the importance of effective communication, this club is certainly it.

                <h1>PSU Rugby Team Manager</h1>
                <li>I don't know how many photos I have of this but I used to be a Penn State Rugby Team Captain. Will edit this wording.
                    Mostly, I was in charge of helping to set-up for practice and film plays, and most importantly live-streaming all games 
                    + answer all comments/questions on the livestream. Basically, I was the entire tech-team.

            So, let's start with my first official design! At the time, I was a junior in High School, and super fortunate to have been 
            given the oppurtunity to join on a trip from my hometown, New Holland, PA, to its twin city, Longvic, France in celebration of
            the 50 year anniversary of their partnership. I was incredibly excited to be responsible for designing the logo/graphics for 
            the commemorative gear that the town mayor was making for the trip. At the time, all I had was some pretty-serious Microsoft 
            Word/PowerPoint skills, and no access to any legitimate design software (I could not install any applications because I only
            had access to a school laptop (which prevented it)), but I did have a vision, which overall, I made happen. Overall, I would
            go back and change several elements of this design if I could, there is no denying that it is quite crude.

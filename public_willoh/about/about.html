            <h1>Hi! I see you've found my webpage.</h1>
            <p>
                Please note, I am new to programming and web design. In fact, this site is still very much 
                in it's early stages. Feel free to take a look around, and come back later to see my progress! I have created this website to
                sort of bookmark my progress and showcase my abilities, as well as serve as a bit of a personal portfolio. You can think of 
                it as a more informal type of resume. So, let's get into it!
            </p>

                    One of my most prominent passions in life, and most longterm hobbies, is an interest in graphic design. I love 
                    the idea that graphics can be used to inspire feeling, and in a business sense, inspire action in subtle ways that 
                    extend far beyond that which words can. I also adore the concept of practical and intuitive design, particularily when 
                    it comes to customer-brand interaction. This to say, my passion for graphic design is one of my largest motivators for 
                    learning how to program- as a means to create clean, efficient, effective web designs which look professional and
                    are easy to use. I am detail-oriented, and this often is a huge advantage as I delve deeper into it all. I aspire
                    to one day work with graphic design in industry in one capacity or another, and as I start my professional career, I 
                    don't know that there is a better time. 

                    As such, I do not have a long list of prestigious clients and people I have created grapics for professionally yet. 
                    I have created most of my graphics as small elements for the various webpages I have made in practice, and am sorry 
                    to admit that most have been disposed of as I have torn down webpages to create new ones given limited domain space.
                    My most notable graphic design achievement to date is redesigning the logo for Penn State University's International 
                    Student Council after seeing an advertisement for a graphic design competition on a campus poster, included below.

                    I have created several designs over time, many of which are similar in nature.

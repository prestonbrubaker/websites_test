            <h1>Hi! I see you've found my webpage.</h1>
            <p>
                Please note, I am new to programming and web design. In fact, this site is still very much 
                in it's early stages. Feel free to take a look around, and come back later to see my progress! I have created this website to
                sort of bookmark my progress and showcase my abilities, as well as serve as a bit of a personal portfolio. You can think of 
                it as a more informal type of resume. So, let's get into it!
            </p>
            <h2>Design</h2>

                    I often sum up one of my most prominent passions to an interest and knack for graphic design. Often, 
                    this instills visions of digital art and social media adverstising in people's heads. While this is, perhaps, a fair 
                    assumption, I do not participate in social media, nor do I have any interest in doing so. Sure, I can illustrate both 
                    digitally and not to a respectable level, particularily for someone who never did any sort of formal study of anything 
                    artistic past middle school art class. This said, I am deeply interested in brand representation. I am super passionate 
                    about the idea of of fonts, colors, and images serving as an artistic representation of an idea, an identity. Of course, 
                    in this stage of life, I only pursue embarking in such graphic design as a hobby, and my highest achievement in regards 
                    to it is redesigning the logo for Penn State's International Student Council, included below.

                    <br>This taken into consideration, it is most fair to say rather that I have a passion for <u>practical</u> design- 
                    design with intention, purpose, and function. What interests me in brand identity is the oppurtunity to inspire individuals 
                    to take action, or feel certain things, based entirely on intentional design. It isn't the drawing itself so much as
                    the puzzle of navigating the idea of creating something memorable, but also representative of certian ideas/ideals.

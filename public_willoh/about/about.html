                Hello, I'm Willoh, I need to come up with a zinger for right here. While 
                I may not have extensive industry experience, I possess a unique blend of technical skills and
                adaptability that sets me apart.<br><br>
                
                Although I am taking a break frm my Mechanical Engineering Schooling in pursuit of some industry
                experience and a renewed confidence that that is the right direction for me, I am relentlessly passionate 
                about learning and growing both personally and professionally. In recent times, that has manifested
                itself in computer programming, resulting in the creation of this website.<br><br>
                
                As far as the programming goes, though by no means is that the extent of my skillsets, I can work with the following:<br>
            </p>
        </section>

        <ul id="languages">
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>SQL</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="information">
            <br>That said, programming certianly isn't all I do. As far as everything else, it's probably fair to say that 
            I dabble in a little in a little bit of everything. As far as software:  
        </p>
        
        <ul id="software">
            <li><b>Microsoft Suite:</b> Word, PowerPoint, Outlook, Excel </li>
            <li><b>Adobe Suite:</b> Illustrator, Photoshop, Lightroom </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="information">
            Computer skills aside, it's probably worth mentioning my not as technical aptitudes. Elaborate on all of this, 
            girly pop. In the meantime, I like reading. Fav books:
        </p>

        <ul id="books">
            <li><b>Brave New World</b> by Aldous Huxley</li>
            <li><b>Ender's Game</b> by Orson Scott Card</li>
            <li><b>Doctor Faustus</b> by Christopher Marlowe</li>

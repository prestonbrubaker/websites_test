            <h1>Hi! I see you've found my webpage.</h1>
            <p>
                Please note, I am new to programming and web design. In fact, this site is still very much 
                in it's early stages. Feel free to take a look around, and come back later to see my progress! I have created this website to
                sort of bookmark my progress and showcase my abilities, as well as serve as a bit of a personal portfolio. You can think of 
                it as a more informal type of resume. So, let's get into it!
